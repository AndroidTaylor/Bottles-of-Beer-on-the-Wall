# Bottles-of-Beer-on-the-Wall
This python3 program takes an arbitrary amount of bottles and progressively gets more distorted as time continues. It is supposed to appear like the speaker is getting more and more drunk.  

Feedback and suggestions would be appreciated, be as harsh or gentle as you'd like!
